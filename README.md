# Assembler for Texas IC Led Driver Family LP5569

## Description

The LP5569 device is a programmable, easy-to-use 9-channel I2C LED driver designed to produce lighting effects for various applications. The LED driver is equipped with an internal SRAM memory for user- programmed sequences and three programmable LED engines, which allow operation without processor control. Autonomous operation reduces system power consumption when the processor is put in sleep mode.

Creating of the lighting effect is done by writing a program to run in the devices, this should be done manually and traduce it in binary sequence. TI provides a software tool that can be used with the Eva board to control and help develop lighting effects by writing assembly code.

The tool is complete, but it is a GUI for the developed kit, so it only runs in Windows and is quite limited in text editing.

So, I decided to write my asm tools that allow you to write down an asm application with your favorite text editor and to run it everywhere.

## Feature

The assembly is written in Python for ease of use on all platforms and fast development. To check if the generated binary is correct, I use ase reference to the binary generated by the EVA GUI tools, and I tested it on 2 lp5569 connected in to the same bus.

Now the feature are:
- fully comply with all instructions set 
- all src for lp5569 could be assembled
- generate the same hex file
- generate the .c and .h source file to link in your c procjec
- cli inteface
- clear error messages

## What next?

- Write a deassembler from the bin and program index.
- asm code analisys
- Implement a meta-language to make pattern development easier
- Simulator

# Usage

The asm uses standard Python3 without any dependencies.
In the `src` folder you could find some example of asm that we use in the unittest.

To assemble src, you just do this:
```
~/src/github/ti_lp55xx_asm · (main ±)
➜  python lp5xxx_asm.py src/test1.src   
```
By default the output is `hex` file.

If you want to generate also a .c .h source file as well:

You can specify manually specify the .c and .h name with its path.

If you want overwrite the default output filename:

There is the possibility to build more src files at the same time, the output will be one hex file for each source file you would build. If you specify the `-c` switch to build source files, the behavior is the same. But if you specify the `-o` switch to overwrite the default output, all sources will be merged into the given filename
